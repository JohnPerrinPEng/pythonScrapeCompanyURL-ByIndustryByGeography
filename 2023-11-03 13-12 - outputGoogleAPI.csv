Coherent interconnects for converting photons between different wavelengths are highly desired. Although coherent interconnects have conventionally been realized with nonlinear optical effects, those systems require demanding experimental conditions, such as phase matching and/or cavity enhancement, which not only bring difficulties in experimental implementation but also set a narrow tuning bandwidth (typically in the MHz to GHz range as determined by the cavity linewidth). Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate coherent information transfer between two orthogonally propagating light beams of disparate wavelengths in a fiber-based optomechanical system, which does not require phase matching or cavity enhancement of the pump beam. The coherent process is demonstrated by interference phenomena similar to optomechanically induced transparency and absorption. Our scheme not only significantly simplifies the'"
